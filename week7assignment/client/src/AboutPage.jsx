        <p>Looking to rate adventurers you have met on your journeys?</p>
        <p>
          Fed up of subpar adventurers who are nothing but loot hungry murder
          hobos and want to warn others?
        </p>
        <p>
          Got someone who used their only diamond to bring you back from the
          dead and want to praise their efforts on your quest
        </p>

        <p>
          You may find them listed here, ready to be left a review to advise
          other adventurers of their merits or downfalls. Whilst we ask you to
          be accurate, we hope that you do be mostly kind about it.
