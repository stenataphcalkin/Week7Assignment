🏹 Use react-router-dom to create a dedicated route for the categories
For example, /posts/:categoryName.
🏹 Allow users to delete posts.
🏹 Add ‘like’ functionality on posts.
🏹 Create additional SQL queries to show filtered posts.

# Status 1 Render issue

Spoke to Bertie on Friday, and Manny confirmed that this error code is due to the initial upload being established, and that once code is populated beyong the initial commit, this will resolve once code is established.

This error happened last week with an error 254 too, which caused concern.

Turned off Render failure notifications / emails for my own sanity.
