# Base Goals

✅ Create a client using React.
✅ Use Express to create your server, using both GET and POST endpoints.
✅ Build a React form for users to create posts.
✅ Create multiple pages using React Router.
✅ Design a database schema, and seed the database with some realistic data.
😕 Use SQL to retrieve posts from the database in your Express server.
😕 Display all posts using .map(). - is under the all reviews component with some outlined code.
😕 Use an interval and useEffect() to poll your database.

😕 = attempted without being able to retrieve the data.

# Stretch Goals

✅ Create dynamic pages using react-router-dom.
✅ Use react-router-dom to create a dedicated route for the categories
For example, /posts/:categoryName.
🏹 Allow users to delete posts.
🏹 Add ‘like’ functionality on posts.
🏹 Create additional SQL queries to show filtered posts.

Overall, a much better week in terms of personal stuff, and despite feeling ill in the week, if an absolute headache of a task due to tech issues. I've been trying to prioritise my own well-being and take time to selfcare, and know when to take breaks, and to step back when I have exhausted what I have to handle it with the time I have. Trying to give myself the space to submit something, knowing that something is better than burning out over trying to hit perfect and not give myself time to rest. Especially as this is likely the last time I'll have the time to see friends outside of the course until November, and sorely needed to recharge my social battery.

# Issues faced:

A lot of ECONNRefused errors, I've reset the password multiple times, Supabase even flagged about mismatching passwords, so I tried again, but it continues to be an error that is causing me a great deal of stress and I cannot seem to resolve this matter. It appears to connect, but for some reason it fails to retrieve.

My antivirus keeps flagging Supabase's connections, I've allowed them and cannot see why this would be causing issues as I've done supabase work on here before.
Keeps flagging with internal server errors, reminescent of the week 4 attempt to do this project.

Through a constant vicious circle between server.js and dbConnection.js insisting pool or process is not defined, despite changing one, then the other throws another error in the other; after 90 minutes of vicious circling combined with pleading to a rubber duck to help, I have given up and will lay the rest of the code out as otherwise intended for the calls etc. I did try to consult Gemini for any common troubleshooting for this, but it suggested solutions I had already tried.

Due to prior arrangements commitments to meeting up with friends following last week's PTSD flareup, Sunday was written off, limiting time to review the project and attempt anything. Frankly needed the time for selfcare and being with loved ones, and following my selfcare guide lines from the careers assignment, I need to acknowledge when is time to step back to minimise stress.

Additionally, with moving onto next.js next week, and the troubles had with Render, I am moving them as a priority til after we handle the next.js and vercel parts of the course and intend to revisit these in depth and sandbox after the course so I don't jeopardise the upcoming assignments and final projects by trying to look at retrospective aspects. From here I will be playing around more with SQL queries to try and establish why I couldn't get the tables to connect despite doing it previously with the Digimon sandbox.

Despite these issues, react-render-dom stretch goals were attempted, the first one was implemented successfully, and the second was put in place in the theoretical code for handling the retrieval, and posting of data. Due to being unable to implement the data properly, I cannot verify.

## Status 1 Render issue

Spoke to Bertie on Friday, and Manny confirmed that this error code is due to the initial upload being established, and that once code is populated beyong the initial commit, this will resolve once code is established.

This error happened last week with an error 254 too, which caused concern.

Turned off Render failure notifications / emails for my own sanity.

Sat 3pm: Render is still failing to resolve the error code 1. Stating that index.html can't be resolved. Will revisit later.
Sun 8pm: Both web service and static site are failing to give me anything but an error 1, and Supabase still won't connect the tables. I'm at a loss.

## Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.

Please suggest any references and resources that may be useful for trouble shooting the issues faced with Supabase not processing the SQL to join the code, despite seemingly processing successfully in the SQL editor, and any advice on why status 1 on Render was such a headache.
