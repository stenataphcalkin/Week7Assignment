# Base Goals

✅ Create a client using React.
🎯 Use Express to create your server, using both GET and POST endpoints.
✅ Build a React form for users to create posts.
✅ Create multiple pages using React Router.
✅ Design a database schema, and seed the database with some realistic data.
🎯 Use SQL to retrieve posts from the database in your Express server.
🎯 Display all posts using .map().
🎯 Use an interval and useEffect() to poll your database.

# Stretch Goals

✅ Create dynamic pages using react-router-dom.
🏹 Use react-router-dom to create a dedicated route for the categories
For example, /posts/:categoryName.
🏹 Allow users to delete posts.
🏹 Add ‘like’ functionality on posts.
🏹 Create additional SQL queries to show filtered posts.

# Status 1 Render issue

Spoke to Bertie on Friday, and Manny confirmed that this error code is due to the initial upload being established, and that once code is populated beyong the initial commit, this will resolve once code is established.

This error happened last week with an error 254 too, which caused concern.

Turned off Render failure notifications / emails for my own sanity.
